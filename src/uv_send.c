/* The happy path for an io_uv_send request is:
 *
 * - Get the io_uv_client object whose address matches the one of target server.
 * - Encode the message write buffers into the client->stream handle.  Once the
 * - write completes, fire the send request callback.
 *
 * Possible failure modes are:
 *
 * - The io_uv->clients array has no client object with a matching address. In
 *   this case add a new client object to the array, add the send request to the
 *   queue of pending requests and submit a connection request. Once the
 *   connection request succeeds, try to write the encoded request to the
 *   connected stream handle. If the connection request fails, schedule another
 *   attempt.
 *
 * - The io_uv->clients array has a client object which is not connected. Add
 *   the send request to the pending queue, and, if there's no connection
 *   attempt already in progress, start a new one.
 *
 * - The write request fails (either synchronously or asynchronously). In this
 *   case we fire the request callback with an error, close the connection
 *   stream, and start a re-connection attempt.
